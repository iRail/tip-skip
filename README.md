Project vision
--------------
First of all this is a proof of concept base approach to an SMS ticketing platform and or application.
The proof of concept must show to which extent this project can be realised and if so the possibilities
should be unveiled.

The main goal is to provide an platform where mobile payment services are offered. The platform should 
easen the process of acquiring such SMS tickets. Examples of such tickets are those provided by 
[De Lijn](http://www.delijn.be/en/verkooppunten/sms_ticketing_copy.htm) or 
[4411 parking tickets](http://www.4411.be/en/).

In general there are two thought processes; buying via one's mobile phone or buying for a phone from a 
computer at distance.

### Buying from one's mobile phone
When people buy SMS tickets they do this mostly because they lacked the time to buy a 'real' ticket in advance
or just don't have the time anymore to buy one. Maybe the 'ticketeer' is short in cash but he decides to use the 
money on his phone instead.
