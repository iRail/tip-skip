SMSBroker
=========

The main goal is to provide a platform where mobile payment services are 
offered. The platform should easen the process of acquiring such SMS 
tickets for example [De Lijn](http://www.delijn.be/en/verkooppunten/sms_ticketing_copy.htm) and 
[4411](http://www.4411.be/en/).

Project vision
--------------
Our strenght should lay in numbers because today there are already a handful of apps available to receive
SMS tickets, but they only provide an interface for one specific SMS ticket. Furthermore usability and easiness
should also differentiate us as these SMS tickets are mostly acquired JIT. Additional features such as location
based offering of mobile payment services and saving commonly used SMS tickets should be implemented for
ultimate usability.

In general there are two general thought processes:
1. Buying via one's mobile phone.
2. Buying for a phone from a computer at distance.

Currently following tickets are to be considered:
1. NMBS
2. De Lijn
3. Parking
