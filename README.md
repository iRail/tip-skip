Project vision
--------------
First of all this is a proof of concept base approach to an SMS ticketing platform and or application.
The proof of concept must show to which extent this project can be realised and if so the possibilities
should be unveiled.

The main goal is to provide a platform where mobile payment services are offered. The platform should 
easen the process of acquiring such SMS tickets. Examples of such tickets are those provided by 
[De Lijn](http://www.delijn.be/en/verkooppunten/sms_ticketing_copy.htm) or 
[4411 parking tickets](http://www.4411.be/en/).

Our strenght should lay in numbers because today there are already a handful of apps available to receive
SMS tickets, but they only provide an interface for one specific SMS ticket. Furthermore usability and easiness
should also differentiate us as these SMS tickets are mostly acquired JIT. Additional features such as location
based offering of mobile payment services and saving commonly used SMS tickets should be implemented for
ultimate usability.

In general there are two general thought processes; buying via one's mobile phone or buying for a phone from a 
computer at distance.

Currently NMBS, De Lijn and parking tickets are taken in to consideration.
