Project vision
--------------
First of all this is a proof of concept base approach to an SMS ticketing platform and or application.
The proof of concept must show to which extent this project can be realised and if so the possibilities
should be unveiled.

The main goal is to provide an platform where mobile payment services are offered. The platform should 
easen the process of acquiring such SMS tickets. Examples of such tickets are those provided by 
[De Lijn](http://www.delijn.be/en/verkooppunten/sms_ticketing_copy.htm) or 
[4411 parking tickets](http://www.4411.be/en/).

In general there are two thought processes; buying via one's mobile phone or buying for a phone from a 
computer at distance.

### Buying from one's mobile phone (BfP)
When people buy SMS tickets they do this mostly because they lacked the time to buy a 'real' ticket in advance
or just don't have the time anymore to buy one. Maybe the 'ticketeer' is short in cash but he decides to use the 
money on his phone instead, again probably just in time before he needs the ticket.

Therefore the main priority is speed and usability. Mostly no extra data is necessary to acquire such a ticket.
A one-click does-it-all-approach should be envisioned.

### Buying for a phone from a computer (BfC)
The purpose is somewhat different when buying an SMS-ticket from your computer which is to be sent to your phone.
This will mostly be used when planning your trip beforehand. The 'ticketeer' would be able to avoid the hassle of 
buying a 'real' ticket.

Field of study
--------------
Decent research is needed in search of possible solutions to our two solutions.

Too have a visual goal through this project it's recommended to create a
